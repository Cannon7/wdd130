                <p>steps to get them
                    a. Assessment: Begin by evaluating your energy needs, budget, and the available space for solar panel installation. Consider factors such as orientation, shading, and local regulations.
            
            b. Research and Quotes: Conduct thorough research to identify reputable solar panel providers in your area. Obtain multiple quotes, comparing factors such as cost, quality, warranties, and customer reviews.
            
            c. Design and Financing: Work with a professional installer who will assess your site, design a customized solar system, and determine the financing options available. Options may include cash purchases, loans, power purchase agreements (PPAs), or leasing. A PPA is when a company installs solar panels on top of your home and gives you a split of profit/savings
            
            d. Permits and Installation: Secure the necessary permits and approvals from local authorities. Once all paperwork is complete, the installation process can begin. Skilled technicians will mount the solar panels on your roof or in your yard, ensuring optimal efficiency.
            
            e. Connection and Monitoring: After installation, the system must be connected to the electrical grid. This step often involves coordinating with your utility company. Monitoring software allows you to track your solar panel's performance and energy production.
